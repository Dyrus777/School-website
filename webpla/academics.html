                <h3>Our Vocational K2 Curriculum Overview</h3>
                <p>Our unique curriculum blends traditional early childhood education with age-appropriate vocational themes. Children engage in play-based learning that introduces them to various professions, from community helpers like doctors and firefighters to engineers and artists. We use thematic units, interactive stories, and creative projects to teach foundational literacy, numeracy, and scientific concepts, all while exploring the purpose and importance of different vocations in society.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Language Arts:** Storytelling, phonics, early reading, writing readiness through themed activities.</li>
                    <li>**Mathematics:** Counting, number recognition, basic shapes, patterns, and measurement through practical tasks like "building a house" or "running a mini-shop."</li>
                    <li>**Science & Discovery:** Exploring natural phenomena, plant growth (e.g., school garden), simple machines, and cause-and-effect related to various jobs.</li>
                    <li>**Social Studies & Community:** Understanding different roles in the community, basic geography, and cultural awareness.</li>
                    <li>**Arts & Crafts:** Creative expression through drawing, painting, sculpting, and craft projects often tied to vocational themes.</li>
